The "divisibleby4.js" automatically fills your document with blank pages so that the total page count is divisible by four. In your page layout of PDF Template, you can add this:

  `<div data-region="content">

     <script src="divisibleby4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <script>autoFillPages({ multiple: 4 });</script>

  </div>`

   
Whatever value is given in multiple above, that is honoured. If you give 5 then total page count will be divisible by 5.

Note: You will need to upload this js file in your template folder.
